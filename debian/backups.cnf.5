.SH NAME
backups.cnf \- config for wmfbackups orchestration
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
backups.cnf is a YAML file with pairs of keys containing the
configuration of backups executed when using
.B backup-mariadb
It includes general config to apply to all backup jobs, and
the individual config for each one.
All the values set at the root level will be considered as
defaults.
Subkeys will be considered backup definitions and they can
override global config.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
 user: 'test'
 password: 'test'
 compress: true
 rotate: true
 retention: 3
 archive: false
 sections:
 s1:
   host: 's1-master.eqiad.wmnet'
 s2:
   host: 's2-master.eqiad.wmnet'
   archive: true
.TP
In this example, a databse user and password have been set for the global config of all sections. It also has set to return a compressed tarball that will be deleted in 3 days. No archival by default.
.TP
2 backups will be generated on each run, one for s1 (from the given host) and one for s2 (from a different host). s2 has overriden the no archiving global configuration, so it will have inside its tarball, one tar file per database. s1 will keep the global configuration.
