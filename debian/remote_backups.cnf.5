.TH REMOTE_BACKUPS.CNF: "5" "March 2022" "wmfbackups-remote" "File formats"
.SH NAME
remote_backups.cnf \- config for wmfbackups remote orchestration
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
remote_backups.cnf is a YAML file with pairs of keys containing the
configuration of backups executed when using
.B remote-backup-mariadb
It includes general config to apply to all backup jobs, and
the individual config for each one. All the values set at the
root level will be considered as
defaults.
Subkeys will be considered backup definitions and they can
override global config.

The main difference between backup.cnf and remote_backup.cnf is
that remote_backup.cnf must contain a destination key where
the backup is sent remotely using transfer.py (instead of
generating the backup locally).

.SH "EXAMPLES"
 type: snapshot
 compress: true
 rotate: true
 retention: 3
 archive: false
 stats_file: /etc/wmfbackups/statistics.cnf
 sections:
 s1:
   host: 's1-master.eqiad.wmnet'
   destination: dbprov1009.eqiad.wmnet
 s2:
   host: 's2-master.eqiad.wmnet'
   destination: dbprov1008.eqiad.wmnet
.TP
In this example, a snapshot backup type has been defined as the global config for all sections. It also has set to return a compressed tarball that will be deleted in 3 days. No archival by default. Stats will be gathered.
.TP
2 backups will be generated on each run, one for s1 (from the given host) and one for s2 (from a different host). s1 will be sent to dbprov1009 and s2 will be sent to dbprov1008.
